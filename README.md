Pre-built .bin and .cue files can be found at the [itch.io page](https://hardrockbluesky.itch.io/bambis-knees-bambis-shaking)

### Build environment
* Windows XP VM from [PSXDev.net](https://www.psxdev.net/help/virtual_machine.html) [ I ran mine in Hyper-V instead of VPC 2007 but you can use that image ]
* PSY-Q, Sony's SDK included with that image or [available here](https://www.psxdev.net/downloads.html) with setup help [here](https://www.psxdev.net/help/psyq_install.html).
  
This project uses [MBGames' PS1 Homebrew Source Code](https://mbdesigns.itch.io/ps1-homebrew-source-code-rendering-3d-graphics-with-psyq) as a base, and I fully recommend it as a place to get started if you want to make homebrew for PS1. There are some additional PSY-Q quirks mentioned in his files that you may need to take care of before BKBS will compile.
